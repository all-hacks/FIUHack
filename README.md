# FIUHack

The Idea is to create a ChatBot platform that enables consumers to apply for loan via Social Media.

This platform auto populates information provided by consumers and combined with the approval process, reduces application time.
Moreover the platform would consume this Social Media information (ie. #tags, Pictures and location) to provide all new personality risk profile for bank to make better judgement on whom they on Boarding.

Social media ID will be another form of identity to be used to perform AML KYC process on top of the traditional information.
1.    Customer Name, Business or Legal Entity Name
2.    Address
3.    Date of Birth (for Individuals)
4.    Identification Number

The Social Media ID can then be store in replacement for where traditional Identification Number are not present (ie. where multiple customer name are matched at 80%). The Social Media ID will then be share with other Financial Institution which will reduce the amount of time and effort to redo the matching list of names.
